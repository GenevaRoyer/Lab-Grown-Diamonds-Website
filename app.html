    <!--What is a lab-grown diamond? What are methods of creating them?-->
   <p class="description">
    Lab-grown diamonds are diamands created in a laboratory using the three methods: high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) method, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, and ultrasound cavitation method [1].
    <br></br>
    The high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) method is the cheapest method. In this method, the belt press, the cubic press, and the split-sphere press apply heat and pressure into the diamond seed. The diamond seed is placed into pure carbon. Heat and pressure melts the carbon surrounding the seed, creating a diamond around the seed. The diamond carefully cools and hardens around the seed. Later, jewelers cut and polish the raw lab-grown diamond for jewelry and other usages. Weighting several hundred tons, the presses form a pressure of 5 GPa at 1500째C (2732째F) [1,2].
    <br></br>
    Secondly, The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method develops diamonds using hydrocarbon gas mixture.A diamond seed is placed in the mixture. At low pressure, atomic hydrogen reacts to the gas creating lab-grown diamands. The benefits of using CVD over HPHT are lower pressure requirement of approximately 27 kPa and flexibility in size and composition [1,3].
    <br></br>
    In the ultrasound cavitation method, diamond microcrystals are placed suspension of hexagonal graphite in various organic liquid media at 248째F (120째C) and at atmospheric pressure [1,4].

<!--Lab-grown diamonds vs mined diamonds-->
<h3 class = "properties">Properties Compared with Natural Diamonds:</h3>
<ul class="properties">
<li><strong> Mechanical Properties:</strong> Lab-grown diamonds have a very low coefficient of friction, increasing the diamonds' lifespan and decreasing fossil fuel emissions [1].</li>
<li><strong>Optical Properties:</strong> Lab-grown diamonds have widest spectral band of all Earth's materials  [1].</li>
<li><strong>Thermal Properties:</strong> Lab-grown diamonds are known to have the highest resistance to thermal shock and the highest thermal conductivity of Earth's materials. They also have low thermal expansion [1]. </li>
<li><strong>Electronic Properties:</strong> Lab-grown diamonds can insulate low current and high voltage due their high electrical carrier mobility, excellent electrical insulator properties, low dielectric constant and loss, and a wide electronic band gap [1]. </li>
<li><strong>Acoustic Properties:</strong> Lab-grown diamonds have extremely high acoustic properties. They are able to make CVD diamond tweeters to achieve frequencies of 70 kHz [1].</li>
<li><strong>Electrochemical Properties:</strong> Lab-grown diamonds are extremely durable. They can withstand extreme chemical, physical, and radioactive environments and oxidize organic and inorganic compounds due to their chemical makeup [1]. </li>

<!--Price of Lab-grown Diamonds-->
<h3 class="price">The Price of Lab-Grown Diamonds</h3>

<p class="price">
The price of lab-grown diamonds is 40%-50% less than the cost of mined diamond, due their supply chain. The mining diamonds requires a complex, integrated system with six stages: production, rough diamond sales, cutting and polishing, polished diamond sales, jewelry manufacturing, and retail sales. Each stage involves large amount of paid workers. Unlike the mined diamond industry, the lab-grown diamond industry is more divided and more simple with the diamonds being formed, polished, and made into jewelry in the same company.
Lastly, the lab-grown diamond industry must also compete with mined diamond industry and each other [16].

<!--What questions should you sk you jeweler-->
<h3 class = "question">Two Questions You Should Ask Your Jeweler</h3>
<p class="question">
<strong>1. Is the lab-grown diamond certified?</strong>
<br></br>
To determine if your diamond is lab-grown and if your diamond is high quality, ask your gemological laboratories, such as Gemological Institute of America (GIA), International Gemological Institute (IGI), and Gem Certification & Assurance Lab (GCAL), 
to give you an official diamond certification with the 4Cs grading of <stong>carat, color, clarity and cut</stong> [16].
<br></br>
<strong>2. How can I test the diamond?</strong>
<br></br>
There are two methods of testing the diamond: inexpensive handheld diamond test and a costly diamond screener [16].

<h3 class = "resale">Do Lab-Grown Diamonds Have Resale Values?</h3>
<p class="resale">
Yes, lab-grown diamonds have resale values. However, they depreciate with time. You can resale lab-grown diamonds similarly to mined diamonds [17].
